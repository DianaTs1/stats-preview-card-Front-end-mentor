## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I decided to practice with CSS grid in this project. I learned a lot by reading this documentation: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/

I also realized that if you want to change the position of an individual grid item you should use both grid-column-start and grid-row-start properties, giving just one property would not get the job done (struggled with this a little bit).

Also I am getting used to the global CSS variables and html landmarks.


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    :root {
  	--blue-background: hsl(244, 38%, 16%);
  	--soft-violet: hsla(277, 64%, 61%, 0.445);
  	--paragraph-color: hsla(0, 4%, 81%, 0.75);
  	--heading-color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.6);
  } 
}
```
